# Cat and Dog Image Classification Using SVM
This project implements a Support Vector Machine (SVM) to classify images of cats and dogs from the Kaggle dataset.

## Dataset
The dataset used for this project is available on Kaggle: [https://www.kaggle.com/c/dogs-vs-cats/data]

## Project Structure
train: Directory containing training images.
test1: Directory containing test images.
svm_classifier.py: Script to preprocess images, train the SVM model, and evaluate its performance.

## Requirements
--> Python 3.x
--> OpenCV
--> NumPy
--> Scikit-learn
--> Psutil

## You can install the required libraries using the following command:

bash
```
pip install opencv-python-headless numpy scikit-learn psutil
```
